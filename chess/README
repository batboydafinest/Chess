Updates:
-There are several updates since our alpha release. Most importantly, all our pieces can move
now without crashing the program. Our program also supports special moves such as en
passant and castling.
-It can also check for check/checkmate.
-This release includes a player vs. player version of the game, but does not support the option
for playing against a computer and does not support a log file that displays the events of the 
game yet.
-Also, checking for check/checkmate and supporting en passant are still in the works.


Instructions:
To run the program, type ./chess. More detailed instructions for the installation can be found in
the user manual.
